# **Getting Started**
## **Overview**
Web Repository allows users to build and run automated tests for web applications. This is a brief document on how to get started with Web Repository. For additional information reference the larger documentation as a whole.

## **Web Repository Basics**
Web Repository can be summed up in the following points:

- Test Setup & Building – Creating a project, a module, a script, and adding steps to that script
  - *Networking (whitelisting/vpn tunneling) [specific section in documentation but add this to every service’s docs.]*
- Execution & Reports – Executing a test script and viewing the outcome in the reports
- Test Case Management – Setting up a Sprint, using Test Lab, versioning, and branching scripts
  - Versioning
  - Branching
## **Test Setup & Building**
In this section what will be discussed is creating projects, modules, scripts, and adding steps to that script.
### **Creating a Project**
1. Click on Web Repository 
1. Click on ‘New Project’
1. Enter a project name
1. Enter a project description
1. If there are any other Team Members working on the project, you can add them by dragging their name from the left panel to the right panel.

### **Adding Steps**
Test steps are comprised of three important components:

- Description
- Action Type – what the step will do
- Element Locator & Value – what the step will interact with

Depending on the action type used, additional data and parameters may be required.

<img src="https://dmdug58z0ycm2.cloudfront.net/production/pub-site/images/_webimages/Add_Steps_1.png">

1. The first step we are going to create, and one of the most common first steps is a launch
   1. A launch tells the browser what domain we are heading to, and testing. 
   1. To navigate to the proper action click the dropdown à “Launch” à “Go to url"

<img src="https://dmdug58z0ycm2.cloudfront.net/production/pub-site/images/_webimages/Add_Steps_2.png">
