# Test Repository
Test Repository is where the user goes to create and store their test scripts. All test scripts will live within the Test Repository and then imported into Sprints and Test Lab in order to be utilized in different fashions.

## Versioning & Restoring Scripts <!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
A user can version their script in the Test Repository in order to have restore points to be able to revert to. This allows the user a wider dynamic range of test script usage.
