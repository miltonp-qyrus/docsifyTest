# Project Setup

## Remote Devices<!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
Remote devices will allow the user to generate JSON data for an application file. 

This can be done by first clicking on ‘Remove Devices’ located on the panel on the left side of the screen.

**Note**: Before moving on, an application file must be successfully uploaded. If a file was not uploaded, please refer to the ‘Application Files’ section of the documentation.

After clicking on ‘Remote Devices’, three new panels will appear. The left panel is a list of all of our devices, the bottom right panel is a form where the user will select their APK or IPA files and the top right panel will give the user device info such as the remote host, the remote port, and the remote path.

**Note:** APK files can only be ran on android devices and IPA files can only be ran on iOS devices; therefore, if the user only has an APK file downloaded, the user can only select Android devices.

Next, the user is going to want to select an available device on the left panel. Then, on the bottom right panel, the user is going to select an APK or IPA file, then select an App Activity package. After this form has been filled out, click on ‘Generate JSON’.

After clicking on the ‘Generate JSON’, a JSON of the selected APK or IPA will be displayed below the right panel.
