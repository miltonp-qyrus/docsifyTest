# Getting Started

## Overview<!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
Device Farm gives access to real devices for manual and automated testing. Users can run their own automated tests (Appium) or run manual tests by connecting to a device and navigating through with their mouse and keyboard. Upon completion, a detailed report that contains device vitals, logs, screenshots, and performance data is generated.
