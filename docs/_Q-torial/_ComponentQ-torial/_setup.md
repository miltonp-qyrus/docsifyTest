### Description:

In component testing project setup regards the setting up of the component project, which means each individual component needs to be considered. In our case, we would need to setup the mobile device, pool and the application we are using. Project setup is an integral part of the component testing process. This is where the desired device(s) are chosen, alongside any other file or device management, database configuration, and global variable input. 

<u> Step 1 </u>

From the Component Dashboard, select the Setup card. Next on the left side of the screen select the device pool tab. Here select, the New Device Pool button located in the center of the screen. Select the desired devices, enter a device pool name, and hit the save and continue button.

<u> Step 2 </u>

Navigate and familiarize yourself with the global variables tab, located beneath the previously selected Device pool tab. This is the location to set up global variables that run across component scripts. In this case if there was similar data being used consistently in both the mobility and component script, it would be worthwhile to set that data into a global variable and simply call the variable name throughout scripts. Using the add button you can enter the data including variable names, and locators.
