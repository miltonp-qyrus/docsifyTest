### description

Because we are using a web and mobile script, before we can begin with the step building and verification process, we must first import the desired scripts. The importation process is very useful because it allows you to take previously created and functioning scripts from varying services and connect them efficiently to provide full scale, end-to-end tests. In this case we will need to import two previously created scripts, and connect them accordingly to build out our component test.

<u> Step 1 </u>

Import Worksheet 5 from the web tutorial. Keep in mind this is a multiple step process which requires initially flagging the script in the web repository and then using the import button in the component testing platform to complete the process by selecting the desired web script, followed by the accompanying component project.

<u> Step 2 </u>

Import the mobility flow from the recorder mode worksheet, within the mobile testing Q-torial. Keep in mind this is a multiple step process which requires initially flagging the script in mobility, and then using the import button within the component testing platform to complete the process by selecting the desired web script, followed by the accompanying project. 

<u> Step 3 </u>

Navigate into the Component dashboard into the Components tab. Next, navigate into the components card by clicking the design button, and here, select the web card. You will see the previously imported script. Click into the script by selecting the go to component button, and click the red send for approval button located on the top right corner of the screen.

<u> Step 4 </u>

Navigate back into the components card by clicking the design button, and here, select the mobile card. On this page, you will see the previously imported script. Click into the script by selecting the go to component button, and click the red send for approval button located on the top right corner of the screen.
