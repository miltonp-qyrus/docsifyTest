## Description

In this Q-torial we took pre-build web and mobile tests, and connected them to run an end to end test. Not only were we able to run the tests in tandem using the component testing platform with verifications, we also took previously stored variables with data from the web component, and input them into our mobility component seamlessly. The ability to bounce variables and other data, do cross platform verifications, ensure your web applications, mobile applications, and APIâ€™s are integrating seamlessly through the Qyrus Component testing platform.
