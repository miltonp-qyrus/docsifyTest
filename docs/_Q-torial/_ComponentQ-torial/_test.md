### Description

Now that our components are imported and project has been set up, we can continue into the test building process. In this worksheet, we will connect our web and mobile components and edit certain steps to depict how data is shared end to end. This is the final part of the component test, where we define component interaction alongside the data transferred. Note the simplicity and efficiency of the process, as we complete our component test.

<u> Step 1 </u>

From the Component dashboard select the Test card. Next, click the create test button located on the top right corner to create a test. Enter a test name, module name, and description then click the create test button. 

<u> Step 2 </u>

Upon approval the components will be shown on the left side of the screen. Here you will click the yellow plus icons, on both components and they will appear in the connect view. Next click the add connection button located on the top left corner of the connections screen and add an arrow from worksheet 5 (web) to the component script (mobility). Save the connection using the green save icon on the top right corner of the page. 

<u> Step 3 </u>

Upon saving, we will look directly to the right and click the Next button. Here we will see the step building page from our previous components. Click the developer mode toggle located on the top right corner of the page.

<u> Note </u>

Within the component script, nearing the final steps of the script we are setting the key, and nickname values. These values are currently set as empty or desired values as part of the mobility script within our mobile testing component. 

When we look at our web script, the exact same values have not only been set, but stored as variables. Because of this these variables are accessible across the component script and can be used anywhere, including within the mobile test.

<u> Step 4 </u>

Scroll to steps 39 and 40 in the component script which should mirror the set key and set nickname steps from the import worksheet. The steps should contain blank fields for variables, within which, using the dropdown we will select ‘Nickname’ ‘Authentication Key’ and ‘Nickname’ accordingly.
