# Getting Started
## Overview <!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
When you need to test a whole project that has multiple sections, the Component platform will allow the user to break those large projects into smaller components using either the Web, Mobile or API platoform. By breaking down and testing the components, you are able to figure out where errors occur much easier and faster.
