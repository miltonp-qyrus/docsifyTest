# Design Components

## Setup
Design Components is the section of the Component platform where users can create individual API, Mobile, and/or Web components, which then can be sent off for approval so they can be used for tests.

In order to begin designing components, the user must first navigate into a project by clicking on the ‘Select Project’ button.

The user will then be directed to the Component Dashboard. From here, the user will be presented with options to design components, test components, and do a project setup. The user’s ability to perform these tasks depends on the roles that were assigned to them during ‘Project Setup’. There are three different roles a person can be.

1. ***Designer***: Designers can design and test components; however, they cannot approve a component to sending it to the testing stage.
1. ***Reviewer***: Reviewers can design, test components, and approve a component to the testing stage; however, Reviewers cannot approve the components they specifically created.
1. ***Tester***: Testers are not able to design or approve components to the testing stage. The tester is only allowed to tests components after it has been approved. 

Therefore, if the user’s role is not Designer or Reviewer, the user will not be able to design components.

In order for a user to begin designing components, click on the ‘Design’ button.
