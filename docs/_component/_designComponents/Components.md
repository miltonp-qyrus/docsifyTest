#### API
##### Create Component
After navigating into Component Design and clicking the ‘Select’ button under the API section, the user can begin creating their components. If the user has not built a component in the API category before, the user will have three options available for building a component. These options include: 

1. Importing a Swagger URL
1. Uploading a Swagger JSON
1. Creating a manual API test

All steps on importing and uploading via Swagger can be viewed in the API Testing Documentation under API Performance -> Create Test Script.

When creating a Manual API Testing, the user must click on the ‘Add’ button under ‘Create Manual API Test’. After clicking on the button, a form will appear that will require the user to enter:

1. Component Name
1. Module Name
1. Component Description

After filling out the form, click on ‘Create Component’ button and the newly created component will appear.

If a component has already been created, then the user can create another component by clicking on the ‘Create Component’ button located on the left panel.
