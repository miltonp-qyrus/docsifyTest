# Configuration
## Database Configuration <!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
This is where you will be creating a simple database that will be used in your testing **if needed** to do a complete test. If your test does not require some sort of database you can skip this step

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new configuration
1. Create name for the database
1. Choose between MySQL or PostgreSQL
   1. MySQL handles simpler database while PostgreSQL handles complex queries and massive databases
1. Create a hostname to create its location where your database is located i.e, **db.examplehostname**
1. Create a port number to be able to connect directly to the database or another application to the database, **Default value: 3306**
1. Create a database name, **specific**, to the database, gives it an identity when trying to call the database
1. Create a username and password to limit the access to your database. If you would like others to use your configured database, give them your **username and password**
