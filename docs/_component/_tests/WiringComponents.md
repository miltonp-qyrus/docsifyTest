# Tests
## Wiring Components<!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 

Upon the addition of two or more components, each of them must be wired. The center of the screen holds the connections display. This allows the User to create connections between components and build out complete component tests. Note there is a delete and reset button on the top right corner of the display, and a handy reset view button in case the user loses track of the components
