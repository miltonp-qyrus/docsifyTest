### Importing an API
Swagger is a suite of API developer tools used to automate API processes across the entire API lifecycle. 
In order to import a script from swagger, the user must: 

1. Copy and paste a swagger URL into the ‘Import Swagger URL’ form
2. Click ‘Get API’s’

For this example, we will be using the Pet Store API. The link can be found here: 

- <https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json>

**Note:** Make sure there is no white space before or after the Swagger URL when pasting it into the input form.

After clicking on ‘Get APIs’, a list of APIs will appear with checkboxes next to their names. The user then: 

1. ` `Selects the checkboxes for the API’s they would like the generate
2. Click ‘Generate Test Script’
