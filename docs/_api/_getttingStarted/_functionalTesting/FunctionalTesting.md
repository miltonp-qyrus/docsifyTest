Fill out your boxes with:

**Name: Dog Facts**

**Description: Gets dog facts**

**Context path: api/v1/resources/dogs/all**

**Protocol: https**

**End Point: dog-facts-api.herokuapp.com/**

**Port Number:**

**Verbs: Get**

## Execution

1. Hit save and hit the play button to continue
1. Give the **Test** a few seconds to initiate and run, pressing the **refresh button** afterwards it will update the test status whether it **passed** or **failed**
1. You can view in detail of the test to see what kind of information you grabbed since we did a **GET** API

Here you are able to see all of the different charts:

- The **Pass/Fail Ratio** Graph show you how many of your tests have passed versus how many have failed
- The **Run Frequency** Graph tells you how many times you've run each test script.
- The **Execution Time** Graph is a line graph that describes the time it took for each test to run.
