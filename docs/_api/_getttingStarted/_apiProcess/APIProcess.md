After clicking on ‘Create Flow’, the user will be able to create connections for their APIs. This can be done by clicking on the ‘+’ icon on the left panel that’s associated with the API they want to add. 

After adding at least two APIs, a user can create a connection by clicking on the ‘Add Connection’ button on the top left of the page, then dragging an arrow from one API to another.

After creating a connection, click on the ‘Save’ icon on the top right of the page. Then the user will click on the ‘Next Page’ icon directly to the left of the ‘Save’ icon.

When the user clicks on ‘Next Page’ they will be able to see ‘Connection 1’. From here, the user will enter the JSON path, a parameter and a key name. 

The user will then click on the ‘Save’ icon and then run the test.
