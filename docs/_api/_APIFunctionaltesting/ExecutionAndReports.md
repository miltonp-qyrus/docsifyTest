### Execution
Now letâ€™s **Test** our API to see if it works, on the **top right** corner save and run the API, you will be **navigated** straight to the report page

Give the **Test** a few seconds to initiate and run, pressing the **refresh button** afterwards it will update the test status whether it **passed** or **failed**

You can view in detail of the test to see what kind of information you grabbed since we did a **GET** API

As you can see in the **Response Body** you received all dog facts

### Reports

Once you are satisfied with your tests results you can see all of your tests in the reports page, found by pressing the **Reports** button on the top left corner![](../../../_media/_apiImgs/Aspose.Words.1a0bb08a-a30f-4674-a26b-60d476b195cd.006.png)

Here you are able to see all of the different charts:

- The **Pass/Fail Ratio** Graph show you how many of your tests have passed versus how many have failed
- The **Run Frequency** Graph tells you how many times you've run each test script.
- The **Execution Time** Graph is a line graph that describes the time it took for each test to run.
