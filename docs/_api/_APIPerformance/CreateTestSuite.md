# Performance Testing
Performance Testing includes increasing the load and see how the system behaves under higher load. Here, you can monitor response times and also view the status code of each request.

## Create a Test Suite <!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
A Test Suite is an area for a user to store their collection of test cases.

However, before creating a test suite, the user needs to navigate into the ‘Performance Testing’ section. This can be done by navigating into a project and clicking the ‘Performance Testing’ tab located on the top left of the page.

From here, the user is going to click the ‘Create New Suite’ button. 

After clicking on the test, a form will appear that prompts the user to:

1. Enter a test suite name
