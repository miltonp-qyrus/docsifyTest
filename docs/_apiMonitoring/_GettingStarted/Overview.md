# Overview
## API Monitoring <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The API monitoring service can help you monitor the status of all your APIs and help your team catch any issues with your APIs before your clients do. With API monitoring, you will: 

- Organize your APIs into collections
- Schedule periodic calls for each API in your collection
- Set custom alerts for your APIs
- Observe the behavior of your APIs individually and as a collection
- Receive a detailed summary report regarding the overall health of the APIs in your collection

Like the API testing service in CTC, the API monitoring service is organized in a Team, Project structure. A team of users works on multiple projects, a project contains a set of API collections, and a collection is comprised of multiple APIs.

## Overview <!-- {docsify-ignore} --> 
With API Monitoring, you can run periodic calls to your API to determine the overall health of your API. This is a brief tutorial and how to get started with API monitoring. For more details and additional features on the API Monitoring service, see the API Monitoring Knowledge Base documentation.
